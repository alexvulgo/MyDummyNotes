# MyDummyNotes
Recreating the iOS app "Notes" for educational purposes only.

Alessandro Esposito Vulgo Gigante

# Description: 

The application is easy to use. There is a simple screen where we can see all the notes, including the date, a line of text, and a small preview of the image.
We can either read notes that have already been created or create new ones.   By clicking on 'Done,' the note will be saved in memory and we can edit it or add an image.
The ability to add more images and remove those we don't like was also included.
The data is saved in memory by Swift data.
There is also the possibility to delete notes with a simple swipe.

The application provides multiple accessibility features, such as the ability to switch between light and dark modes and support for VoiceOver and Dynamic Type.
When the application detects that the user has enabled the larger text option, a different interface will be displayed on the screen to support dynamic type.
As you can see from the image, if the option is enabled, the notes information will no longer be displayed horizontally but vertically, and the preview of the photo will be enlarged to allow the users to easily check their notes.
